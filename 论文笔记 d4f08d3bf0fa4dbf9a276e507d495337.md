## introduction

---

Graph-based methods can reveal the suspiciousness of these entities at the graph level, since fraudsters with the same goal tend to connect with each otherTextual features

GNN-based methods aggregate聚合 neighborhood information to learn the representation of a center node with neural modules. They can be trained in an end-to-end and semi-supervised fashion, which saves much feature engineering and data annotation cost.

## motivation：

- ignoring the camouflage behaviors of fraudsters
- the limitations and vulnerabilities of GNNs when graphs have noisy nodes and edges
- Though some recent works have noticed similar challenges, either fail to fit the fraud detection problems or break the end-to-end learning fashion of GNNs
- Directly applying GNNs to graphs with camouflaged fraudsters will hamper the neighbor aggregation process of GNNs.

## two types of camouflages:

- Feature camouflage:  fraudsters may adjust their behaviors, add special characters in reviews, or employ deep language generation models to gloss over explicit suspicious outcomes
- Relation camouflage:  fraudsters camouflage themselves via connecting to many benign entities

## method:

1. For the feature camouflage: label-aware similarity measure to find the most similar neighbors based on node features. Specifically, we design a neural classifier as a similarity measure, which is directly optimized according to experts with domain knowledge (i.e., annotated data).基于标签感知的相似性度量计算其邻居相似性 
2. For the relation camouflage: devise a similarity-aware neighbor selector to select the similar neighbors of a center node within a relation. Furthermore, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively find the optimal neighbor selection threshold along with the GNN training process. 
3. We utilize the neighbor filtering thresholds learned by RL to formulate a relation-aware neighbor aggregator which combines neighborhood information from different relations and obtains the final center node representation获得中心节点表示

## advantages & benefits:

- Adaptability. CARE-GNN adaptively selects best neighbors for aggregation given arbitrary multi-relation graph.
- High-efficiency. CARE-GNN has a high computational efficiency without attention and deep reinforcement learning.
- Flexibility. Many other neural modules and external knowledge can be plugged into the CARE-GNN

## steps：

![Untitled](%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%20d4f08d3bf0fa4dbf9a276e507d495337/Untitled%201.png)

1. construct a multi-relation graph based on domain knowledge. 
2. first compute its neighbor similarities based with proposed label-aware similarity measure.基于标签感知的相似性度量计算其邻居相似性，通过对比节点特征来寻找最相似的邻居。
    1. high time complexity×
    2. employ a one-layer MLP as the node label predictor at each layer and use the l1-distance between the prediction results of two nodes as their similarity measure.在每一层采用一层MLP作为节点标签预测器，并使用两个节点预测结果之间的距离作为它们的相似性度量
        1. Optimization. To train the similarity measure together with GNNs, a heuristic approach is to append it as a new layer before the aggregation layer of GCN [ 20 ]. However, if the similarity measure could not effectively filter the camouflaged neighbors at the first layer, it will hamper the performance of following GNN layers. Consequently, the MLP parameters cannot be well-updated through the back-propagation process. To train the similar measure with a direct supervised signal from labels, like [ 35], we define the cross-entropy loss of the MLP at l-layer asv       the similarity measure parameters are directly updated through the above loss function.为了与gnn一起训练相似性度量，一种启发式的方法是在GCN[20]的聚合层之前添加一个新的层。但是，如果相似性度量不能有效地过滤第一层的伪装邻居，则会影响后续GNN层的性能。因此，MLP参数不能通过反向传播过程很好地更新。为了用来自标签的直接监督信号(如[35])训练相似度量，我们定义了l层MLP的交叉熵损失，因为相似度量参数直接通过上述损失函数更新。
3. Similarity-aware Neighbor Selector：Then filter the dissimilar neighbors under each relation with the proposed neighbor selector.相似度感知的邻居选择器：使用邻居选择器过滤每个关系下的不同邻居：选择一个中心节点的某个关系下的相似邻居。另外，在训练过程中，使用强化学习（RL）自适应地找到最佳邻居选择阈值
    1. It selects similar neighbors under each relation using top-p sampling with an adaptive filtering threshold.它使用具有自适应滤波阈值的top-p采样在每个关系下选择相似的邻居。
    2. formulate the RL process as B(A,f,T).A是action space，f是reward function，T是terminal condation. an initial pr(l)初始阈值
        1. action: The action represents how RL updates the pr(l) based on the reward
        2. reward: The optimal pr(l) is expected to find the most similar (i.e.,minimum distances in Eq.
        3. define the reward for epoch e as：epoch e的奖励定义为：
            1. 当epoch e ee上新选择的邻居的平均距离小于前一个epoch时，奖励为正，反之为负。但估计累加奖励并不容易，因此设计了无需搜索的贪婪策略，使用即时奖励来更新动作。
                
                ![Untitled](%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%20d4f08d3bf0fa4dbf9a276e507d495337/Untitled%202.png)
                
        4. 终止条件：
            1. RL在最近的10个epoch收敛，并发消息最优阈值。 RL模块终止后，过滤阈值固定为最优阈值，直到GNN收敛。
            
            ![Untitled](%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%20d4f08d3bf0fa4dbf9a276e507d495337/Untitled%203.png)
            
4. Then, the GNN is trained with partially labeled nodes supervised by binary classification loss functions. The neighbor selector is optimized using reinforcement learning during training the GNN.用二元分类损失函数，使用部分标记节点进行监督训练。训练期间使用强化学习优化邻居选择器：构造一个关系感知的邻居聚合器，该聚合器将来自不同关系的邻居信息结合起来，得到最终的中心节点表示。
5. Instead of directly aggregating the neighbors for all relations, we separate the aggregation part as intra-relation aggregation关系内聚合 and inter-relation aggregation关系间聚合 process. During the intra-relation aggregation process, the embedding of neighbors under each relation is aggregated simultaneously. Then, the embeddings for each relation are combined during the inter-relation aggregation process. 
    1. intra-relation neighbor aggregation:

    2. inter-relation aggregation: 
        
        ![Untitled](%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%20d4f08d3bf0fa4dbf9a276e507d495337/Untitled%205.png)
        
6. Finally, the node embeddings at the last layer are used for prediction.

做出了两个数据集

## 存在问题：

mlp预测不准的话，会删掉很重要的或者良性的边。

两种相差很大的benign，互相对对方的学习有帮助

直接删掉会对模型有很大问题
